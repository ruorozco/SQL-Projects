# COVID-19 Vaccination and Disease Analysis Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyze data related to individuals who have contracted COVID-19 and have been vaccinated against the virus. 
The data is organized by countries and continents, 
allowing for a comprehensive examination of vaccination effectiveness and disease spread on a global scale.

## Usage
1. Data Download: Download the two Excel files containing the COVID-19 and vaccination datasets from the following links:
    -CovidDeaths.xlsx
    -CovidVaccinations.xlsx
2. Database Setup: Ensure that you have set up the database containing the relevant data. Instructions for database creation and schema can be found in the SQLQuery1.sql file.
3. Query Execution: Execute SQL queries provided in the SQLQuery1.sql file using your preferred SQL client or interface.
4. Data Interpretation: Analyze the results of the queries to draw conclusions about COVID-19 prevalence, vaccination efficacy, and other relevant metrics.
